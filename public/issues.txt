problems with this project
the front end code was migrated from a non-backbome, non-require supported prototype.
I'm noticing there plenty of spots where the mv* pattern wasn't fully implented
which I'm attempting to correct.
templating capabilty were not fully utilized.
-doesn't follow rest patterns properly (cores should for endpoint)
